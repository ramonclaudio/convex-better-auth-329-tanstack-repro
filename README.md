# convex-better-auth-329-tanstack-repro

Convex queries throw `Invalid session ID` whenever a Better Auth session rotates (`changePassword({ revokeOtherSessions: true })`, cross-domain handoff, custom plugin endpoints that call `setSessionCookie`). The provider's `fetchAccessToken` holds onto the JWT bound to the deleted session. Filed [`get-convex/better-auth#329`](https://github.com/get-convex/better-auth/pull/329) to fix the React-layer state machine.

This repo is the real-app reproduction on the browser stack: TanStack Start + Convex + Better Auth. Confirms the user-visible flicker is not React-Native specific, and shows the React-layer fix alone doesn't close it. The visible window is a Convex WebSocket race, same shape as [convex-js#82](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-js/issues/82).

## Run

You need Node 22+ and a Convex account.

```bash
npm install
cp env.example .env.local
npx convex dev    # one terminal, creates a deployment, fills .env.local
npx convex env set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET "$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
npx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:3000
```

Then in another terminal:

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Toggle the fix

The repo defaults to vanilla `0.12.2` (broken). To swap to the patched build, edit `package.json`:

```jsonc
// broken (vanilla npm)
"@convex-dev/better-auth": "0.12.2"

// fixed (PR #329 build)
"@convex-dev/better-auth": "file:./patches/convex-dev-better-auth-0.12.2.tgz"
```

```bash
npm install --force
# restart npm run dev:web
```

## What you'll see

The page auto-signs-up `alice+<timestamp>@test.com` and shows:

1. Current Better Auth `sessionId` and `useConvexAuth().isAuthenticated`.
2. A Convex query (`api.functions.me`).
3. A "Trigger session rotation" button that calls `changePassword({ revokeOtherSessions: true })`.
4. An event log of state transitions.

In both vanilla and patched builds, clicking the button briefly flickers the Convex query to `UNAUTHED (stale JWT)` for ~500-1500 ms before recovery:

```
… · Convex query: UNAUTHED (stale JWT)
… · Convex query: loading
… · Convex query: authed as alice+…@test.com
```

The patched build runs the React-layer cache invalidation correctly (proven by the [unit-test repro](https://github.com/ramonclaudio/convex-better-auth-329-repro)), but the visible window persists because the Convex WebSocket race is independent of the React-layer cache. See [PR #329](https://github.com/get-convex/better-auth/pull/329) for the full investigation.
